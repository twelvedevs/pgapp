- Light and Dark theme

[Detailed project description](https://twelvedevs.com/portfolio/pgapp) is available on the developer website.

## Tech

PGApp is developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and available for both mobile platforms and Web. As a PWA it does
not require a network connection. The app is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/twelvedevs/pgapp)
on GitHub.

## Algorithmization

The password is generated using two strategies and a developed interaction algorithm. On the first strategy, the
password is generated based on user-selected parameters such as **length**, **letter case**, amount of **numbers and
symbols**. The second strategy utilizes a dictionary of over **58000 words** with an option to choose the password
length and a word separator. Using all the incrementors results in generating a secure password that will take centuries
to crack ðŸ”’.
